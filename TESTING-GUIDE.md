## Guidelines for Writing Tests

- Tests are written in python 3 using pytest. You can run all tests after `make install` with `ctest -V`.

- Tests should be placed in the `test` directory. There are subdirectories for each mode of operation: clang_plugin, cpu_checking, llvm, parser.

- We group tests in two classes: static and dynamic. Static tests check only instrumentation that modifies the code; they dmic tests check the full functionality of instrumenting and running the code.

- All tests should:
  - Have their own directory
  - A .py test file (usually using the same name of the directory)
  - Include a teardown_module function that cleans up everything, usually by calling `make clean` or simply removing object files or other files that are generated by the test

- Usually tests also have a setup_module function that changes the current directory to the directory of the tests (see examples).
